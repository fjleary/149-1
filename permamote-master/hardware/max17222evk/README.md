MAX17222 Evaluation Kit/Breakout Board
======================================

This maxim chip is a new and more efficient low power boost converter 
(80% @ < 10ua, Iq = 350na). 

We wanted an evaluation kit but none are in stock so this breakout will
serve as our evaluation kit.

We specifically want to evaluate boost efficiency, and metrics that might
allow us to use the boost converter for an iCount energy metering system.
